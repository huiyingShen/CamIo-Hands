CLIMBING_LOOPS_SPARSE_002    Climbing Loops on Slide Mound        Climbing Loops offer a fun way to get to the top of the slide mound with secure hand holds for support. 13 large metal loops are mounted at various places up in incline of the slide mound just due west of the slide mound summit. For people with VI is is recommended to use a cane to sense the location of the climbing loops when getting to the top.
DISK_SWINGS_SPARSE_014    Disk Swings        These disc swings are shaped like a large saucer, with rubber edges for one or more to swing togher. Made of hard plastic, and a height for a wheelchair user to get on too. There are three swings here that are attached seperately with plenty of distance between them for safety, but do watch your heads!
DISK_THING_SPARSE_081    Disk Spinner        The disk spinner may seem like a basic spinner, but of all the spinners at Magical Bridge it can offer the most thrilling and challenging spinning experience. The disk spinner almost looks like an enormous thumbtack that isn’t put in the ground perfectly straight. The disk is around 5 feet in diameter. On one side it is 1 foot off the ground and on the highest side it is 3 feet off the ground. So not only will you rotate when you are on the disk spinner, but you will go up and down. Users can sit or lay on the disk, or for a more challenging adventure, stand on the disk and rotate it by walking. The disk spinner is 12 inches high on one side, which is a bit high to transfer from a wheelchair so it would be good to have some assistance to do it. Even those who can’t move much or at all could be lifted and placed on the disk spinner for an enjoyable spin ride.

LASER_HARP_SPARSE_001    Laser Harp    Music zone    The Magical Harp, created by artist Jen Lewin, is a permanent, outdoor motion sensitive instrument . Though the motion sensors are high overhead and out of reach, they detect movements through the 24 laser hards directly under the arch. Much like plucking the string of a harp, passing through the beams triggers custom circuitry and sensors to produce musical notes tuned to the panatonic scale and soothing to many listeners.For more information on this remarkable and innovative installation, please visit CODA Works, where the Magical Harp won a 2016 CODA Award.
MINI_ROLLER_THING_SPARSE_068    Roller Table    Swing Zone    This roller table is designed for those in a wheelchair to transfer onto, and lay flat to make use of the four loop metal bars that are up and down the length of the table. Designed to provide those with limited mobility some sensory benefits for their back, and strengh building for their arms, everyone can enjoy it. Be mindful of hitting your head on those large loops when laying onto the table!
MINISLIDEMOUND_CLIMBING_LOOPS_SPARSE_018    Climbing Loops in Tot Zone        Three large climbing loops are placed strategically on the small tot-friendly slide hill inside this zone to help younger guests with climbing to the top.

PLAYHOUSE_SPARSE_059    Playhouse        The majestic wood playhouse is at the center of this space and features two levels of fun and artisitic beauty for all to enjoy. Designed and built by Barbara Butler and team, it is multi-colored and offers two small round tables and bench seating upstairs to resemble a cafe. There are also windows with metal safety bars which enable visitors to hear activities below and have a view of the whole space. On the ground level of the playhouse is a small semi-circluar stage at the front. A 6 inch bevelled barrier at the edge prevents wheelchairs from rolling off but use your cane to make sure it's not a tripping hazard. Facing the stage to the left, is a fun pretend "magical bakery" where cakes and a cash register out of wood invites imagination. To the right of that is a wood working bench with tools, also made out of wood, which invite more pretend play from all. Both levels of the playhouse have entries that are wheelchair friendly and clearings tall enough for adults of all sizes to enjoy!

POD_1_SPARSE_060    Cozy Cocoon in Spinning Zone        The Cozy Cocoon is a made of plastic and a place for kids and adults, especially those with autism and sensory challenges, to hang out in when active play feels overwhelming and frenetic. The Cozy Cocoon in the Spin Zone is one of three located throughout the playground. A Cozy Cocoon is shaped like a large sphere with openings. There is one large opening in the front with room for one person to sit down in the cocoon, and there are smaller openings in the side and back of each cocoon to use as a window to peer out at the playground. The cocoon can be gently rotated so that the user or a helper can rotate it away from the action and noise. A cocoon's main purpose is to be a calming, cozy place to regroup while observing from the round openings in the cocoon and to re-emerge and re-engage in active play when ready.

RING_THING_SPARSE_066    Nest Spinner        The Nest Spinner is a relaxing spin ride where one or two people curl up safely into the nest and spin slowly and rhythmically making it a good introduction to spinning for those who would find it challenging. The structure of the Nest Spinner looks like two large rings that are both crossed in space and connected together (be careful not to bump your head on the rings). The base of the two rings has a cupped area which is big enough for two people to sit and a constant push on the sides of the rings to cause the nest to rotate.

SPINNING_CONE_SPARSE_076    Net Spinner        The Net Spinner is a combined climbing experience and a spinning experience. The structure of the Net Spinner is a large cone shaped net. The net is anchored at the bottom to a large horizontal disk about 8 feet in diameter and about 1 foot from the ground. Coming up from the center of the disk is pole that is 12 feet. A network of ropes is attached from the top of the pole to the outside edge of the disks to form a net that can be climbed on. A person standing next to the net spinner can push on the ropes in a circular direction causing the entire net spinner to rotate. Many people can climb on the net or sit safely on the disk inside at once. Not only is the net spinner a climbing challenge but you will get some good stimulus to your balance (vestibular) system if someone rotates the net spinning while you are at the top. Keep in mind the whole thing can spin as you are at a height of 8 or more feet off the ground. How do you know if you are ready to climb to the top of the net spinner? People should be comfortable with climbing short distances up and down the net before going to the top.
SPINNING_TABLE_SPARSE_057    Ground Carousel        The Ground Carousel is flush with the ground so everyone can ride. For those who are blind or with other challenging visual impairments, approach the ground carousel with caution. The ground carousel has metal poles that can come around very fast and sometimes people spin with their legs and arms extended out from the carousel. So best if you are visually impaired to ask folks to stop the carousel before approaching it. The carousel has two benches for up to 3 people each to sit on while riding the carousel and also has two magical parking spaces for wheelchairs. To transfer a wheelchair onto the ground carousel simply lift the safety rail, roll into the space provided and park the wheelchair. Set the safety break on the wheelchair, then bring the safety rail down. If you have the arm strength to do it, you can “turn” the disk in the middle of the spinner which will cause the whole carousel to rotate.
STEPPING_SOUNDS_SPARSE_037    Stepping Sounds        The stepping sounds used to provide sounds when a visitor made their way towards one of the main playground entries but, sadly, the city has disabled the sounds.
SWING_BRIDGE_SPARSE_011    Bouncy Bridge        The bouncy bridge is one of two ways to get to the top of the slide hill, where there are 4 unique slides. The bouncy bridge is on the left of the ramp and fully wheelchair accessible.
SWINGS_SPARSE_082    Bucket Swings        The bucket swings are supportive, allowing for use by all abilities, and promote collaborative swinging. The bucket swings have a rigid plastic harness with a metal latching mechanism to keep the rider secure when swinging. The harness hinges are located near the rider shoulders and the whole harness rotates overhead. Be careful to not hit your head on the harness when getting in and out of the bucket swings.
